            <h4>How do I sell a Book?</h4> 
            <p class='answer'> 
            Bring your book to the "Cube" which is by the cafeteria and one
            of our staff members will take your book and add it to the 
            database.  When your book is sold you will be notified by 
            email and then you can come and pickup your money.

            <p class='answer'> 
            Go to the "<a href='{% url list %} '>List Books</a>" page 
            and check off all the books you would like to put a hold on. 
            On the bottom of the page there is a button that says, "Request". 
            When you press that button those books will be put on hold for 
            24 hours for you.  Then just go to the "Cube" which is by the 
            cafeteria with your money and pickup your books.

            <h4>Where do I pickup my books?</h4> 
            <p class='answer'> 
            You can pick up or drop off books at the "Cube". 
            This is beside the cafeteria in Reimer Student Center,
            which you can find on this

            <h4>How do I cancel a reservation of a Book?</h4> 
            <p class='answer'> 
            Go to the "<a href="{% url my_books %}">My Books</a>" page
            and check off all the books you no longer want under 
            "Books I have on Hold".  On the bottom of the page there is a 
            button that says, "Remove Hold".  When you press that button 
            those books will taken off hold for you.

            <h4>How do I know if my book has been sold yet?</h4> 
            <p class='answer'> 
            Go to the "<a href="{% url my_books %}">My Books</a>" page
            and look under "Books I have for Sale".  If you have any books 
            at the "Cube" they will be listed there and beside each book it 
            will say the progress. "For Sale" means no one has bought it yet. 
            "On Hold" means someone has put a reservation on it and needs to 
            come and pick it up. "Sold" means someone has given us money for 
            your book and you can come in and get it. "Done" means all 
            transactions with this book are completed (i.e. you have come and 
            picked up the money or we returned the book to you)
